    "### Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product, or service while monitoring online conversations. However, analysis of social media streams is usually restricted to basic sentiment analysis and count-based metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the recent advances in deep learning, the ability of algorithms to analyze text has improved considerably. Creative use of advanced artificial intelligence techniques can be an effective tool for doing in-depth research. This includes classifying customer conversations about a brand based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key aspects of a brand’s product and service that customers care about.\n",
    "- Users’ underlying intentions and reactions concerning those aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "These basic concepts become a vital tool for analyzing millions of brand conversations with human-level accuracy. Taking the example of Uber, Shashank demonstrates how this works through sentiment and intent analysis.\n",
